# Simple Crypto Data

A simple project to view actual crypto qoutes and their charts in time.
It based on CoinAPI service which collect different markets and data resources.
But it's founded on free CoinAPI account thus it has some restrictions. If you understand you can get your own key from CoinAPI and put it into code dirrectly.

I realised it with Flutter from Google for cross-developing apps. Here I used REST API, Websockets, financial charts and GitHub Action for CI without CD for building and downloading artifacts in Actions tab in GitHub.

P.S. Sorry for bad code. I use it for my experiments :-)
